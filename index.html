                <p>If you still think this is a coincidence then I don't how else to tell you to wake up and realize this shit is real gurl! The "L" word is scary to throw out sometimes, but you have to be able to risk vulnerability, in order to gain happiness.

                <p>Everyone is going to share their opinion on what they think about you, us, and all that we do. Our uniqueness will mess with a lot of peoples perception of "normal," but as long as it keeps turning US on, then who gives a shit what people think.</p>

                </a>
            <p>If this is truly a dream, please don't wake me up. I have been living a nightmare for the past 3 years dealing with all the awful curveballs that the universe has been throwing our way; it has since turned into a great dream that I never want to wake up from. You are the light at the end of the tunnel that I have been meditating for. The only tricky part is I usually wake up from my dreams right when it gets good... I hope to break that habit.</p>
